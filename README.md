# Particle in a Box
Particle in a 1-D box is a special case in one dimensional Quantum Mechanics were a single quantum particle is trapped between two walls of infinite potential. In this project I have implemented a code in python which aims to simulate and animate the time evoloution of a particle in a box with different initial states.
Also, this project contains a code that animates the $\psi\(x, 0\)$ approximated by $\ket{\psi_n}$ s as the bound states are progressively added.

## Problem specification

## Time evolution

## Approximation evolution

The potential is zero within the bound $x \in \[-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}\]$ and $\inf$ elsewhere.
