# Particle in a Box
Particle in a 1-D box is a special case in one dimensional Quantum Mechanics were a single quantum particle is trapped between two walls of infinite potential. In this project I have implemented a code in python which aims to simulate and animate the time evoloution of a particle in a box with different initial states.
Also, this project contains a code that animates the $\psi\(x, 0\)$ approximated by $\ket{\psi_n}$ s as the bound states are progressively added.

## Problem specification
Let's begin with the time independent Schrodinger equation.
<div align="center">
$$
\[-\frac{\hbar}{2m}\frac{d}{dx} + V\(x\)\]\psi\(x\) = E_n\psi\(x\)
$$

$$
i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}\phi\(t\) = E_n\phi\(t\) \implies \phi\(t\) = e^{\frac{-i}{\hbar}E_nt}
$$
<\div>

The potential is zero within the bound $x \in \[-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}\]$ and $+\infty$ elsewhere.
